          <h3>League of Legends</h3>
          <p class="w3-opacity">My first competitve game</p>
          <p>My first main competitive game that I got into was League of Legends. This game was most likely
            what really got me into gaming itself as I spent most of my free time playing this game. I've played 
            this game for about a total of 8 years and my peak rank was Diamond 2 which is part of the top 1%.

          <h3>Apex Legends</h3>
          <p class="w3-opacity w3-text-white">Fun shooter with good movement</p>
          <p>Apex Legends was one of those games I enjoyed playing because I was able to showcase my individual
            skill better. I also really enjoyed the game mechanics, but recently I'm not enjoying the changes the gamedevs
            have been making towards the game. I've spent about 400 hours on the game and I peaked around Diamond rank in the top 5%.

          <p class="w3-opacity w3-text-white">What I moved to after League of Legends</p>
          <p>After I stopped playing League of Legends I went to go find a similar game that felt more enjoyable.
            I found Dota 2 to be much more complicated than League of Legends, but that was what made it more
          enjoyable to me. I haven't played too much Dota 2 so far as I've only got about 100-150 hours on the game, and 
        I'm still only mid-rank in the game. </p>

          <h3>Csgo</h3>
          <p class="w3-opacity w3-text-white">Good competitive shooter game</p>
          <p>Csgo used to also be a game I played a lot when I would want to take a break from League of Legends.
            I enjoyed how the game's shooting mechanic worked and mainly how it felt. The pressure I felt from playing
            made the game seem challenging and fun, but I quit the game because there was a rampant hacker issue. I've spent 
            over 1k hours on the game and reached Legendary Eagle which is just a few ranks away from the top.

  <p class="w3-center w3-large w3-text-white">How gaming has shaped me</p>
  <div class="w3-container w3-text-white">
    <p>If someone were to ask me how was my childhood, it wouldn't be wrong to say that gaming was my childhood.
       Most of the memories I'm fond of are of me playing video games, but I wouldn't really say it was a bad thing. 
       Video games taught me early on that nothing was free and I'd have to work towards something I wanted. They 
       also taught me that hardwork is important, but being efficient is just as important. There are a multitude of things 
       that I've learned from games, both good and bad, but I think the initial experiences helped develop my character. Gaming has 
       exposed me to different viewpoints or scenarios I would've never thought about by myself, and that has allowed me to become 
       the person I am today.

  <h3><b>Plans</b></h3>
  <p class="w3-large">What I plan on doing.</p>
  <div class="w3-container w3-text-white">
    My plans for the future will involved reaching my end goal of creating games I can be proud of.
    My first step to get there is to learn the necessary skills to first create a game and how to bug fix it.
    It is because as of right now I lack most of the necessary skills for creating a game, but what I don't lack
    is the drive towards developing them in the future. I wanted to choose my major knowing that I wanted to do something 
    I would enjoy, and so I swapped to computational media in order to get involved in game and app design. My biggest goal 
    is to create a game that has a big impact others to the point that they are able to relate and learn positively from it.
    I want to create potentially life changing games that will be able to change people for the better, or at least 
    teach them important life lessons subtly.
